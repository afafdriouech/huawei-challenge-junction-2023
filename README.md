## Overview

A visual story-telling app that makes the user progress through the story by the steps he went by. The stories are short, can be completed within 1-2 hours, and require a minimum of 5000 steps to unlock all parts of the story. Detective stories with suspense generate engagement from the user and ensure that he finishes the story.

There are several triggers that reveal map pieces or clues to where to go next. Those triggers are:

- Step count - pedometer (Step counter) Completing the step count reveals a map piece or a clue.
- Getting near distinct location - (GNSS receiver) Real-world location corresponds to different zones in the virtual jungle. Getting near the location will either reveal some new piece of information, unlock a new place to go, or trigger chat with NPCs that will help you. (Proximity detection maybe)
- Playing at different times of the day changes the story - (Temperature Sensor and Ambient Light Sensor): The game advises playing at different times of the day or in different weather conditions for special in-game events. Task: Play during suitable outdoor conditions.
- Proximity radar - sometimes the map turns off and you have a radar that beeps more frequently when you are near the needed location. Wearable devices will beep or vibrate with the same rules.
- Heart BPM changes some parts of stories
- Audio clues when playing in headphones
